# Project Memory Log

## Project Overview
A visually polished, production-ready Snake web application built with Next.js. The game features modern UI/UX, multiple game modes, real-time leaderboards, achievement system, and comprehensive user engagement features. Target audience includes casual gamers, competitive players, and nostalgic players seeking a high-quality Snake gaming experience.

## Key Decisions

### Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js 14+ with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript for type safety and developer experience
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive, utility-first styling
- **State Management**: Zustand for lightweight, performant state management
- **Animation**: Framer Motion for smooth UI animations and transitions
- **Game Rendering**: HTML5 Canvas API for 60fps game rendering
- **Audio**: Web Audio API for sound effects and background music
- **PWA**: Service Workers for offline functionality and app-like experience

### Database
- **Primary Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) for user data, scores, and leaderboards
- **Local Storage**: Browser LocalStorage for user preferences and offline data
- **Caching**: Multi-layer caching strategy (memory cache + localStorage + CDN)
- **Real-time**: Supabase real-time subscriptions for live leaderboard updates

### Deployment
- **Hosting Platform**: Vercel for seamless Next.js deployment and edge functions
- **CDN**: Global content delivery for fast asset loading
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated testing, building, and deployment
- **Monitoring**: Sentry for error tracking, Vercel Analytics for performance monitoring
- **Environment**: Production, staging, and development environments with proper secrets management

### Architecture Decisions
- **Component Architecture**: Modular, reusable React components with clear separation of concerns
- **Game Loop**: RequestAnimationFrame-based game loop for smooth 60fps gameplay
- **Security**: Client-side score validation, rate limiting, input sanitization
- **Performance**: Code splitting, lazy loading, bundle optimization (<500KB gzipped)
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with keyboard navigation and screen reader support
